# Picks the Linux binary for this machine's architecture.

# A bundle manifest names a command per PLATFORM and has no key for the
# architecture, so a Linux entry would otherwise have to be one binary
# and be wrong for everyone on the other one. Claude Desktop for Linux
# ships x64 and arm64 both, so "everyone else" is a real set of people.
# macOS solves this with a universal binary and Windows by running amd64
# under emulation; Linux has neither, so the choice is made here.
#
# exec, not a call: the server talks MCP over this process's stdio, and a
# shell left in the middle would own the pipes.
