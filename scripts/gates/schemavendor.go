// The published schemas this repository's own documents cite, kept here
// so they can be checked rather than merely named.
//
// `mcpb` and `server-json` already hold each document's $schema to being
// present, pinned and agreeing with the version beside it. That is a
// claim ABOUT the reference; none of it opens the schema. A document can
// cite the right file and not satisfy it, and for the registry entry
// that is the expensive direction: an entry cannot be withdrawn, so
// "fails in somebody else's validator" is not a state to recover from.
//
// Vendored rather than fetched, because a gate that needs the network
// fails on a train, and a check that only runs when a CDN answers is not
// a check. Embedded rather than read from disk, so the gate does not
// depend on the directory it was started in.
//
// What vendoring does NOT buy, said here because it reads as though it
// does: a frozen copy cannot notice upstream publishing a NEWER schema.
// The hash below proves these bytes are the ones somebody reviewed, not
// that upstream still serves them. Only a re-fetch shows that, which is
// why `make schema-refetch` exists and why docs/release.md runs it at
// release time rather than this file claiming to cover it.
