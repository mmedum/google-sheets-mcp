// the gate after the gate (#18)" to somebody deciding whether to
// upgrade, which is not who that sentence was written for — and it is
// what this project's release pages carried until 2026-09-13.

// before Run, so ctx.ReleaseNotes is never assigned and the file named
// by --release-notes is never opened: the body collapses to the footer
// alone. A sibling server shipped exactly that and nobody read the page.
// Deleting the changelog block is the way. release.footer keeps working
// either way, because internal/pipe/release/body.go wraps ReleaseNotes
// in it on every path.

// W3C's heading guidance says to avoid, and it is what every release
// page here looked like when the extractor was first written. Lifting
// one level gives h1 then h2, with nothing missing in between, and needs
// no wrapper heading repeating either the word "changelog" or the
// version number GitHub is already showing.
