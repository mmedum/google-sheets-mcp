## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] - 2026-09-06

The first release: the skeleton, the gates, and reading.

### Added

- Four read tools: `get_spreadsheet` (the spreadsheet card, no cell data
  at all), `read_range` (an addressed grid with a checkpoint),
  `search_spreadsheets` (find one through Drive) and
  `find_in_spreadsheet` (text or an RE2 pattern to A1 addresses).
- `login`, `logout`, `status` and `doctor`, plus `--version` and
  `--dump-schemas`. The server keeps serving without credentials and
  answers every tool with `[auth]`, so a client shows a working server
  with an actionable message rather than a failed connection.
- `internal/a1`: the only place that knows how A1 and the API's
  zero-based half-open `GridRange` relate. Total parsing, always-quoted
  sheet titles, and table tests for the traps — a column parser that
  accepts `A1`, and a named range that shadows a same-named sheet.
- A raw REST client with its own wire types, per-user rate limiters at
  Google's documented quota, one request in flight, retries derived from
  the HTTP method, and a host allowlist checked with the port.
- `internal/gapi/sheetstest`: an in-memory Sheets and the one Drive
  endpoint this server calls, with formulas, error cells, notes,
  validation, merges, protected ranges, ragged responses and injected
  failures.
- The repository's own gates, as Go: the coverage floor derived from
  `go list`, the closed error-class vocabulary checked from both sides,
  the identifier and data scan, the workflow pin and shell check, the
  stdio smoke test, the schema dump and diff, and the staleness gate.
- CI on Linux, macOS and Windows with every gate reading every platform;
  CodeQL; Dependabot; a signed, attested GoReleaser release.

### Notes

- Every read is bounded before the request is built, and the bound
  applies to all four output formats: the grid, the rows and the footer
  always describe the same window.
- A range that misses the sheet entirely is refused with the sheet's
  size rather than clamped to its last row, and a search says which
  limit stopped it so the advice names a dial that would help.
- Everything ran against a real account: spikes C and E, the live driver
  (32 steps), and the configuration surface — profiles, read-only scopes
  and `logout`.
- `logout` revokes the OAuth *grant*, not one token, so it signs the
  account out of every profile sharing that client. It says so and names
  them; `logout -local` deletes the stored token without revoking.
- Not tagged. CI has never run on macOS or Windows, and `main` is the
  maintainer's to push.
