// Asking the person (§9a). A write that cannot be undone, or that runs
// a query billed to a Cloud project, is put to the person through the
// client, as an MCP form elicitation, when the client declares it can
// ask. The form has no fields: accepting it is the confirmation. The
// question goes out the multi-round-trip way: the first call does every read, stops
// before the write and returns the question with a signed requestState;
// the call comes back with the answer and that state, reads again, and
// writes only on an accept. Clients on protocols before 2026-07-28 get
// the same through the SDK, which asks with elicitation/create and calls
// the handler again within the same request.
